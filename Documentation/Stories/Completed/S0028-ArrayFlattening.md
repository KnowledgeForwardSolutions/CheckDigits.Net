# S0028-ArrayFlattening

As a developer of CheckDigits.Net, I want the highest performance for all algorithms in CheckDigits.Net. We should examine the possibility of flattening the 2D arrays used by the Verhoeff and Damm algorithms to further optimize performance.

## Requirements

* Implement flattened 2D arrays for Verhoeff and Damm algorithms
* Benchmark changes and see if any improvement

## Definition of DONE

1. Most highly optimized version of Verhoeff and Damm algorithm, with or without array flattening
1. Backed up by benchmarks
