# S0019-ReleasePrep

As a developer of CheckDigits.Net, I want to clean up the codebase prior to the initial release.


## Requirements

* Organize algorithms by category
* Organize supporting classes in test project
* Consistent benchmarks

## Definition of DONE

1. 3 categories of algorithms: General, ISO7064 and ValueSpecific
1. General and ISO7064 algorithms have benchmarks for lengths 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21
1. ValueSpecific algorithms have benchmarks for three different valid values for the type
1. README updates
