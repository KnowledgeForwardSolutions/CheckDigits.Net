# FigiAlgorithm

As a developer of CheckDigits.Net, I want the algorithms included in CheckDigits.Net to be as performant as possible. 

## Requirements

* Review existing algorithm implementations and look for opportunities to optimize further.
* Apply optimizations

## Definition of DONE

1. All algorithms reviewed
1. Optimizations applied where opportunities found
1. All existing unit tests still pass
1. Performance benchmarks

Look at Iso7064Mod1271_36Algorithm character mapping
" Iso7064Mod37_2Algorithm
" AlphanumericMod97_10Algorithm
" CusipAlgorithm
" IbanAlgorithm
" Iso6346Algorithm
" NpiAlgorithm - consider same optimization as Luhn
" SedolAlgorithm
