# S0025-DotNet8LuhnOptimization

As a developer who uses CheckDigits.Net, I want the highest performance available for the Luhn algorithm in CheckDigits.Net. Updating to .Net 8 slightly lowered the performance of the Luhn algorithm.


## Requirements

* Re-optimize Luhn algorithm
* Re-run benchmarks

## Definition of DONE

1. Increased performance for Luhn algorithm
1. Updated benchmarks/readme
